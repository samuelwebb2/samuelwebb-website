Welcome to my new website! After successfully building and maintaining [mathsoc.uk](https://mathsoc.uk) for the University of Edinburgh Mathematics Society during my time at university, I decided it was time to create a personal space to document my projects and share what I'm working on.

## Why This Site Exists

I've always found it valuable to document my work - both as a reference for my future self and to share knowledge with others. This site will serve as a living portfolio and blog where I can write about:

- Homelab projects and experiments
- Technical problems I've solved
- Things I'm learning along the way
- Data analytics, automation, and tooling
- Reflections on maths, computing, and whatever else catches my interest

## The Journey So Far

My homelab journey started back in 2020 during lockdown with my sister's ancient Sony laptop. I loaded it up with Ubuntu Server, stuck it in a cupboard, and ran it headless - and I was hooked. Throughout my university years studying for my MMath in Mathematics at Edinburgh, I spent countless hours tinkering, learning about networking, containerisation, deployment, and building things just to see if I could.

Now the homelab has evolved quite a bit. I'm currently finishing up my new and improved NAS running TrueNAS, complete with a home-made PiKVM and ATX power controls using a custom circuit I built. I'm also experimenting with Proxmox, running a few old laptop motherboards (a nice throwback to those early days) to learn how these tools work while actually using them in my everyday life.

## Where I Am Now

These days I work as an insurance consultant at LCP in London, studying to become an actuary. I'm trying to bring these technical skills into my work - building tools, automating workflows, and doing data analytics. 

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. I'm using the PaperMod theme for its clean, readable design that keeps the focus on content.

The site is hosted on the University of Edinburgh's [tardisproject.uk](https://tardisproject.uk) infrastructure - the same setup I used for the Mathematics Society website. It's a simple but effective deployment pipeline: Hugo generates static HTML, and GitHub Actions automatically deploys it to the server whenever I push changes.

## What's Next

I'm planning to write about my homelab projects, the things I'm building at work, and whatever technical challenges I'm tackling at the moment. I really don't know exactly what this website will become, but I'm excited to find out.

Thanks for stopping by, and here's to many more posts ahead!
